# Clear-Script Blog

**Written by:** Joel Sallow (@vexx32)

I try to credit folks that I take ideas or code examples from as best I can.
The vast majority of the post content here is mine.
If I forgot to attribute you in something I've borrowed, please file an issue or PR so I can sort that out!

## Theme / Template

This blog uses a modified version of the base Jekyll Now theme from [Barry Clark's Jekyll Now repo][jekyll-now].
If you would like to clone it and modify it further, you're more than welcome to.
I'd appreciate it if you refrain from just cloning it in its entirety, though.

Please note that the scant few images here were made by either myself or Adil Leghari (@adilio).
While they are generally considered free to use and "open source" (as much as images can be), please remember to give credit where it's due.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute ideas or request that I write up a post on a particular topic, you're more than welcome to [file an issue][issues]!
Spelling and grammar critique is also welcome; if you'd prefer to file an issue, you can do that, or simply fork the repo and PR the fix.
I don't mind folks forking the repo in order to copy and edit the templates, but please refrain from re-hosting the content (regardless of whether it's generated via Github Pages or something else).
