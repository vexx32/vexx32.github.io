For those not in the loop currently, let's do a quick refresher!
The PowerShell Summit CFP closed on October 1st, and I was lucky enough to get _two_ talks selected!
Wow! :tada:

# What's Going On with the PS Summit's 2020 Session Recordings

I'm genuinely very excited about that, actually.
As a first-time speaker, getting two talks selected is very unlikely.
Certainly, one of them is a joint talk with the lovely [Thomas Rayner][thomas-twitter], but even then it's quite unusual to be trusted with two separate talks as a new presenter.
That's fantastic, and I'll get to which talks I'll be giving in a moment.
However, as some astute folks noticed pretty quickly in the Speakers' Agreement, there's a change to how some things are being handled.

## The Speaker's Agreement

Most of this is pretty standard fare; clarifications on what expenses are covered, schedule finalization, equipment to bring, sessions to deliver, etc.
But let's take a quick look at the section here relevant to recordings, specifically:

> **Recordings and materials.**
> Presenter agrees that all sessions at the event may be recorded, and that recordings will be free of charge to attendees of the program from Pluralsight LLC.
> Presenter understands that Pluralsight LLC will own the distribution rights of the recordings, however the presenter will own the Intellectual property of the presentation.
> Furthermore, the presenter acknowledges that he/she will not receive any compensation (financial or otherwise) from Pluralsight LLC, and that a talent release form may be required 30 days prior to the show.
> Presenter agrees to provide electronic, distributable copy of all session materials such as slide decks, script examples, and so forth for free to the public preferably on https://github.com/.
> Presenter agrees to use Producerâ€™s provided slide deck template if practical.
> A copy of the template will be provided.

Okay, okay, all seems... hold up a minute.
Having never presented before, I cannot speak to how this was handled _precisely_ in the past.
However, having spoken to a good many folks who have presented in past years, **this** is new:

> Presenter understands that Pluralsight LLC will own the distribution rights of the recordings, however the presenter will own the Intellectual property of the presentation.
> Furthermore, the presenter acknowledges that he/she will not receive any compensation (financial or otherwise) from Pluralsight LLC, and that a talent release form may be required 30 days prior to the show.

... Wow, okay.
If you're not familiar with PluralSight, here's a basic overview.
PluralSight are a very high-quality producer and provider of professional media, centred around teaching courses in various topics.
To my understanding, their primary focus is mainly on technical topics, but I cannot speak to their overall scope and what their overall MO is.
I don't use their platform, I quite literally can't afford to.

And at the end of the day, that's the problem.
They want to take content from the Summit&mdash;
which many speakers spend heavily to attend (even with tickets covered and hotels subsidised, there are still generally fairly significant expenses to account for)&mdash;
and they want to be able to claim it as theirs and put it up on PluralSight as a course that the public would (most likely) have to pay a premium to access.

In past years, just about _all_ recordings were made publicly available on YouTube as early after the conference as possible.
This immensely helps the Summit garner new attendees, as well as being an **invaluable** resource to both new and experienced PowerShell scripters to reference in future.
